# Emerson Discord Bot
## A little hobby project by Jeremy
This bot was a small thing thrown together for fun by **The J Hive#1465** on Discord. He owned a little Discord server for his school and wanted to add a bit of flair to it. Using his rudimentary knowledge of JavaScript, he duct-taped and bubble-gummed together a spaghetti monster of a bot. (It works though!)

### Dependencies
If you're going to run this on your machine, you obviously need basic node.js. If you for some reason don't have that, you can get it [here.](https://nodejs.org)
As for code dependencies, you need (for obvious reasons), [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/). You will also need [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) for token storage, [Express](http://expressjs.com/) for the HTTP server, and [node-cron](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-cron) for scheduled tasks.


###### Why did I make a `README.md` anyway? It's not like anyone's going to see it. This isn't open source -J
